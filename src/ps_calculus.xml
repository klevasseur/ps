<p>The first problem in the 2002 Putnam was</p>
<p>Let <m>k</m> be a fixed positive integer. The <m>n</m>-th derivative of
<m>\frac{1}{x^k - 1}</m> has the form <m>\frac{P_n(x)}{(x^k - 1)^{n+1}}</m>
where <m>P_n(x)</m> is a polynomial. Find <m>P_n(1)</m>.</p>
<p>One solution published solution from <xref ref="biblio-putnam-archive"/> follows.  By differentiating <m>P_n(x)/(x^k-1)^{n+1}</m>, we find that

<m>x=1</m> yields <m>P_{n+1}(1) = -(n+1)k P_n(1)</m>.  Since <m>P_0(1)=1</m>, an
easy induction gives <m>P_n(1) = (-k)^n n!</m> for all <m>n \geq 0</m>.</p>

<example xml:id="example-putnam-2022-A1"><title>Putnam 2022 A1</title>
<p>The first problem in the 2022 Putnam was to determine all ordered pairs of real numbers <m>(a,b)</m> such that the line <m>>y = ax+b</m>> intersects the curve <m>y = \ln(1+x^2)</m> in exactly one point.</p>

<p>The solution that follows is from the Putnam Archive, with some additional clarification.</p>
<p>Write <m>f(x) = \ln(1+x^2)</m>.
We show that <m>y=ax+b</m> intersects <m>y=f(x)</m> in exactly one point if and only if <m>(a,b)</m> lies in one of the following groups:
<ul>
<li><p>  <m>a=b=0</m></p></li>
<li><p><m>|a| \geq 1</m>, arbitrary <m>b</m></p></li>
<li><p><m>0 \lt |a| \lt 1</m>, and <m>b \lt \ln(1-r_-)^2-|a|r_-</m> or <m>b \gt \ln(1-r_+)^2-|a|r_+</m>, where <me>r_{\pm} = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1-a^2}}{a}.</me></p>
</li>
</ul>
</p>


 <p>Since the graph of <m>y=f(x)</m> is symmetric under reflection in the <m>y</m>-axis, it suffices to consider the case <m>a \geq 0</m>: <m>y=ax+b</m> and <m>y=-ax+b</m> intersect <m>y=f(x)</m> the same number of times. For <m>a=0</m>, by the symmetry of <m>y=f(x)</m> and the fact that <m>f(x)> 0</m> for all <m>x\neq 0</m> implies that the only line <m>y=b</m> that intersects <m>y=f(x)</m> exactly once is the line <m>y=0</m>.</p>

 <p>We next observe that on <m>[0,\infty)</m>, <m>f'(x) = \frac{2x}{1+x^2}</m> increases on <m>[0,1]</m> from <m>f'(0)=0</m> to a maximum at <m>f'(1)=1</m>, and then decreases on <m>[1,\infty)</m> with <m>\lim_{x\to\infty} f'(x)=0</m>. In particular, <m>f'(x) \leq 1</m> for all <m>x</m> (including <m>x \lt 0</m> since then <m>f'(x) \lt 0</m>) and <m>f'(x)</m> achieves each value in <m>(0,1)</m> exactly twice on <m>[0,\infty)</m>.</p>

 <p>For <m>a \geq 1</m>, we claim that any line <m>y=ax+b</m> intersects <m>y=f(x)</m> exactly once. They must intersect at least once by the intermediate value theorem: for <m>x \ll 0</m>, <m>ax+b \lt 0 \lt f(x)</m>, while for <m>x \gg 0</m>, <m>ax+b>f(x)</m> since <m>\lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{\ln(1+x^2)}{x} = 0</m>. On the other hand, they cannot intersect more than once. Assume there are two points of intersection at <m>x_1, x_2</m> such that <m>x_1 \lt x_2</m> and  <m>f(x_i)=a x_i + b</m>, <m>i=1,2</m>.</p>
 <p>  For <m>a>1</m>, this follows from the mean value theorem.    Then there exists <m>c</m> with <m>x_1 \lt c \lt x_2</m> such that 
 <me>f'(c) = \frac{f(x_2)-f(x_1)}{x_2-x_1} = \frac{(a x_2 + b)-(a x_1+b)}{x_2-x_1} = a</me> which is impossible since <m>f'(x) \lt a</m> for all <m>x</m>.</p>
 <p> For <m>a=1</m>, 
<me>
1 = \frac{(x_2+b)-(x_1+b)}{x_2-x_1} =\frac{f(x_2)-f(x_1)}{x_2-x_1}=\frac{\int_{x_0}^{x_1} f'(x)\,dx}{x_1-x_0} \lt 1,
</me>
which is a contradiction since <m>f'(x)</m> is continuous and <m>f'(x) \leq 1</m> with equality only at one point.</p>

 <p>Finally we consider <m>0 \lt a \lt 1</m>. We will see that there are two lines with slope <m>a</m> that are tangent to <m>y=f(x)</m>.  In both cases, the lines also intersect the functional curve at a second point.  However, if we shift the lower line down or the upper line up, we get a line that intersects at just one point. <xref ref="fig_2022A1" text="type-global" /> is a representative example, where <m>a=0.75</m>.</p>

 <p>The equation <m>f'(x) = a</m> has exactly two solutions, at <m>x=r_-</m> and <m>x=r_+</m> for <m>r_{\pm}</m> as defined above.
If we define <m>g(x) = f(x)-ax</m>, then <m>g'(r_\pm)=0</m>; <m>g'</m> is strictly decreasing on <m>(-\infty,r_-)</m>, strictly increasing on <m>(r_-,r_+)</m>, and strictly decreasing on <m>(r_+,\infty)</m>; and <m>\lim_{x\to-\infty} g(x) = \infty</m> while <m>\lim_{x\to\infty} g(x) = -\infty</m>. It follows that <m>g(x)=b</m> has exactly one solution for <m>b \lt g(r_-)</m> or <m>b>g(r_+)</m>, exactly three solutions for <m>g(r_-)\lt b \lt g(r_+)</m>, and exactly two solutions for <m>b = g(r_\pm)</m>. That is, <m>y=ax+b</m> intersects <m>y=f(x)</m> in exactly one point if and only if <m>b\lt g(r_-)</m> or <m>b\gt g(r_+)</m>.</p>

<example xml:id="example-riemann-limit"><title>Riemann Sums and a challenging integral</title>
<idx>Riemann Sum</idx>
<p>Typical students often have more expertise in calculus than any other subject, but there are often gaps in their understanding of the topic.  One of them is Riemann sums and their role in integration.  A common textbook example is to start with a right Riemann sum of <m>\int_0^1 x^5 \, dx</m>, 
<m> \sum _{k=1}^n \left(\frac{k}{n}\right)^5 \cdot \frac{1}{n}</m> and maybe disguise it to some extent.  Then ask for the limit as <m>n</m> goes to infinity.  Naturally the answer is simply the integral, <m>\frac{1}{6}</m>.   The first part of solving B-1 in the 1976 Putnam was to identify a slightly more disguised example.</p>
<blockquote><p>Evaluate
	<me>\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{1}{n} \sum _{k=1}^n \left(\left\lfloor
  								 	\frac{2 n}{k}\right\rfloor -2
  									 \left\lfloor
  										 \frac{n}{k}\right\rfloor \right) 
	</me>
	</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this case, the function we are integrating is a bit more complicated, and integration is a second issue that isn't so straightforward.  The function is   
<m>f(x)= \left\lfloor \frac{2}{x}\right\rfloor - 2 \left\lfloor \frac{1}{x}\right\rfloor</m>.</p>
<p>Evaluating the integral is non-trivial, but here is an overview.  When working with floor/ceiling functions, one trick  is to assume some condition that lets you work with an equality or inequality to infer more information.  In this case, we assume that  <m>2\lfloor \frac{1}{x}\rfloor =2k</m> for some positive integer <m>k</m>.
<me>\begin{split}
	2\lfloor \frac{1}{x}\rfloor =2k &amp;\Leftrightarrow  \lfloor \frac{1}{x}\rfloor=k\\
	                &amp; \Leftrightarrow k \leq \frac{1}{x} \lt k +1 \\
	 						&amp; \Leftrightarrow \frac{1}{k+1} \lt x \leq \frac{1}{k}
	 			\end{split}</me></p>
<p>Therefore,
<me>\begin{split}
		 k \leq \frac{1}{x} \lt k +1  &amp;\Leftrightarrow 2k \leq \frac{2}{x} \lt 2k +2 \\
											&amp;\Leftrightarrow  \lfloor \frac{2}{x} \rfloor = 2k \textrm{ or } 2k + 1.
	\end{split}</me>
If <m>\frac{1}{k+1} \lt x \leq \frac{2}{2k+1}</m>, we have <m>\lfloor \frac{2}{x}\rfloor = 2k+1</m>; and if <m>\frac{2}{2k+1} \lt x \leq \frac{1}{k}</m>, we have <m>[\frac{2}{x}] = 2k</m>.  Therefore,  on the interval <m>(\frac{1}{k+1}, \frac{1}{k}]</m>, 

<me>f(x)=\begin{cases} 1 &amp; \textrm{if } \frac{1}{k+1} \lt x \leq \frac{2}{2k+1}\\
							0 &amp; \textrm{if } \frac{2}{2k+1} \lt x \leq \frac{1}{k}
							\end{cases}
</me>
and <m>\int_{\frac{1}{k+1}}^{\frac{1}{k}} f(x) dx = \frac{2}{2k+1}-  \frac{1}{k+1}</m></p>
<p>Finally, we have 
<me>\begin{split}
\int_{0}^{1} f(x) dx &amp; = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \left( \frac{2}{2k+1}-  \frac{1}{k+1} \right) \\
						&amp;  = 2 \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \left( \frac{1}{2k+1} - \frac{1}{2k+2} \right) \\
						&amp;  = 2 \left(\left( \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} (-1)^{k+1}\frac{1}{k}\right)  - (1-\frac{1}{2}) \right)\\
						&amp; = 2 \ln(2) - 1\\
						&amp; = \ln(4) - 1
\end{split}</me>

<solution><p>We first generalize the problem of finding the maximizing partition of size 2 for the lower sum of <m>\int_a^b \frac{1}{x} \, dx</m>  for arbitrary real <m>a, b</m> where <m>a \lt b</m>. The lower sum in this case is <m>L=(t_1-a)\frac{1}{t_1} + (b-t_1)\frac{1}{b}</m> differentiating <m>L</m> with respect to <m>t_1</m> and setting the derivative equal to zero yeilds a maximum at <m>t_1=\sqrt{a b}</m>.
  Therefore the optimal partition in part (a) is <m>\left\{1,\sqrt{2},2\right\}</m>. Our general observation can be used to argue that in the general case of <m>n</m> subintervals, the maximum lower sum must be attained with partition points that are powers of the <m>n^{\textrm{th}}</m> root of 2,
   <me>\left\{1,2^{1/n},2^{2/n},\dots, 2^{(n-1)/n)},2 \right\}.</me>

<p>The hour hand of a clock goes around once every 12 hours or, <m>\frac{\pi}{6}</m> radians per hour. The minute hand goes around once per hour, or at the rate of <m>2 \pi</m>  radians per hour.
So the angle <m>\theta</m> between them (measuring clockwise from the minute hand to the hour hand) is changing at the rate of 
<me>\frac{d\theta}{dt} = \frac{\pi}{6}-2\pi \quad \textrm{rad/hr} </me> </p>

 Evaluate 
 <m>\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{n}\ln{\left(\frac{(2n)!}{n! n^n}\right)}</m>.

<answer><p><m>\ln{4}-1</m></p></answer>
<solution><p>We can simplify the logarithm in the limit first:
<me>\ln\left(\frac{ (2 n)!}{n! n^n}\right) = \sum_{k=1}^n \ln{(\frac{n+k}{n})}</me> </p>
<p>The limit then becomes <m>\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=1}^n \ln{(1+\frac{k}{n})}</m>, which is the limit of Riemann sums for the integral <m>\int_0^1 \ln{(1+x)}\,dx</m>, which evaluates to <m>\ln{4}-1</m>.</p></solution>
