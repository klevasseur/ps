<p>In a town with <m>n</m> people, <m>m</m> clubs have been formed. Every club has an odd number of members, and every two clubs have an even number of members in common. Prove that <m>m \leq  n</m>.</p>
<p>Let <m>v_i</m> be the membership vector for club <m>i</m>:  <m>(v_i)_j = 1</m> and only if person  <m>j</m> belongs to club <m>i</m>. W view these <m>m</m> vectors as being in the vector space <m>\mathbb{Z}_2^n</m> of <m>n</m>-tuples of integers mod 2.  We will prove that the set of vectors <m>\{v_1, v_2, \dots, v_m\}</m> is linearly independent, which implies that <m>m \leq  n</m>.</p>
<p>The conditions of problem translate to the following with respect to the dot products of these vectors.
<me>\textrm{Each club has an odd number of members }\Rightarrow  v_i\cdot v_i = 1</me>
and
<me>\textrm{Any two clubs have an even number of members in common }\Rightarrow  v_i\cdot v_j = 0 \textrm{ if }i\neq j</me>
</p>
<p>Now, assume  <m>\sum_{i=1}^m c_i v_i = \vec{0}</m>.  We will show that each <m>c_k = 0</m> using the linearity of the dot product.
<me>
\begin{split}
0 &amp; = v_k \cdot \vec{0}\\
	&amp; = v_k \cdot \sum_{i=1}^m c_i v_i\\
	&amp; = \sum_{i=1}^m c_i (v_k \cdot v_i)\\
	&amp; = c_k (v_k \cdot v_k)\\
	&amp; = c_k
\end{split}
</me>
Therefore we have derived the inequality.</p></example>

<exercise>
<statement>
<p> Let <m>A</m> be a square matrix, <m>A \neq I</m>, and suppose there exists a positive integer <m>m</m> such that <m>A^m=I</m>.  Calculate <m>det(I + A + A^2 + \cdots + A^{m-1})</m>.</p>
</statement>
<hint><p>The matrix that you want the determinant of is a finite geometric series.</p></hint>

<solution><p>In general, we have 
	<me>(I +  A + A^2 + \cdots + A^{m-1})(I -A)=(I-A^m).</me>
But the right side is the zero matrix and so for every nonzero vector <m>x</m>, 
<me>(I +  A + A^2 + \cdots + A^{m-1})(I -A)\vec{x}=\vec{0}.</me>
Since <m>I-A \neq \vec{O}</m>, there exist nonzero vectors <m>\vec{x}</m> and <m>\vec{y}</m> such that <m>(I-A)\vec{x} = \vec{y}</m>.  This gives us 
<me> (I +  A + A^2 + \cdots + A^{m-1})\vec{y}=\vec{0}</me>
which implies that <m>I +  A + A^2 + \cdots + A^{m-1}</m> is singular and so its determinant is zero.

<statement>
<p>Let <m>n</m> be a positive integer, and let <m>v_1, v_2, \ldots ,v_k</m>, <m>1\leq k\leq n</m>, be linearly independent vectors in <m>\mathbb{R}^n</m> spanning a subspace <m>V_k</m>. Prove that there exist <m>k</m> orthogonal vectors <m>w_1, w_2, \ldots ,w_k</m> that span <m>V_k</m>.  (Note: Two nonzero vectors are orthogonal if their dot product is equal to 0.)

<statement>
<p>Let <m>A</m> be the <m>n\times n</m> matrix whose entry in the <m>i</m>-th row and <m>j</m>-th column is <m>\frac{1}{\min (i,j)}</m> for <m>1 \leq  i,j \leq  n</m>. Compute <m>\det (A)</m>.</p>
</statement>
<hint><p>Expand the determinant along the last row of the matrix.</p></hint>
<solution><p>Let <m>A_n</m> be the <m>n</m> by <m>n</m> version of the matrix. Assume <m>n \geq 3</m>. Expand the determinant of <m>A_n</m> along the last row. If <m>1 \leq k \leq n-1</m> then the minor <m>M_{n k}</m> is the determinant of a matrix with two identical columns, which is zero.    This leaves two nonzero term in the expansion. In both of the terms, the minor is the determinant of <m>A_{n-1}</m>.  Therefore, 
<me>det(A_{n}) = - a_{n,n-1}  det(A_{n-1}) + a_{n,n-1}  det(A_{n-1}) =\frac{-1}{(n-1)n} \cdot det(A_{n-1}).</me></p>
<p>Combining this recursion with the initial values of <m>det(A_{1})=1</m> and <m>det(A_{2})=-frac{1}{2}</m>, we see that  <m>det(A_{n}) = \frac{(-1)^n}{n! (n-1)!}</m></p></solution>

<p>The dashboard of a nuclear power station has several lights. Some lights are on and some are off. There are also several buttons. Pressing each button changes the state of several lights (from on to off and from off to on). It is known that for every set of lights there exists a button connected to an odd number of lights in this set. Show that one can turn off all lights by pressing some buttons.
</p>
</statement>
<hint><p>Start by creating a matrix, one row for each button and a column for each light.</p></hint>
<solution><p>Assume there are <m>n</m> buttons and <m>m</m> lights.  Let <m>A</m> be the <m>n \times m</m> matrix such that <m>A_{i j} = 1</m> if and only if button <m>i</m> is connected to light <m>j</m>.  Let <m>\Delta</m> be a set of lights.  We represent this set by an <m>m</m> dimensional column vector <m>\delta</m> such that <m>\delta_{i} = 1</m> if and only if light <m>i</m> is in <m>\Delta</m>. </p></solution>
