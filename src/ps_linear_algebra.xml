<p>In a town with <m>n</m> people, <m>m</m> clubs have been formed. Every club have an odd number of members, and every two clubs have an even number of members in common. Prove that <m>m \leq  n</m>.</p>
<p>Let <m>M</m> be that <m>n \times m</m> matrix where <m>M_{ij}</m> is equal to 1 if person <m>i</m> belongs to club <m>j</m>, and 0 otherwise.

<p>The dashboard of a nuclear power station has several lights. Some lights are on and some are off. There are also several buttons. Pressing each button changes the state of several lights (from on to off and from off to on). It is known that for every set of lights there exists a button connected to an odd number of lights in this set. Show that one can turn off all lights by pressing some buttons.
