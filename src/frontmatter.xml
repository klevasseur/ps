<p>This book is designed for use in a university course for students who are not at the Putnam Fellow level, but who aspire to compete in the Putnam.  If you belong to the faculty of a college or university, you may request a pdf with solutions to many of the problems in this book. Do this by sending me proof in the form of a URL listing you as faculty that includes an email address that matches the email address of your message.  Send it to <email>kenneth_levasseur@uml.edu</email>.</p>
<!-- <p>Many of the concepts introduced in this text are illustrated using SageMath code.  SageMath (<url href="http://sagemath.org">sagemath.org</url>).  This, of course, is not a resource students have in the Putnam but the idea is to demonstrate how appropriate use of technology be useful in everyday mathematical activity.</p> -->
