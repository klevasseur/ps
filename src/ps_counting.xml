<title>Counting and Indirect Proofs</title>
<introduction><p>In the second class, we focus on some counting techniques and indirect proofs.  Again, we spend only a short time reviewing these concepts after having discussed some of the problems from week 1.  Leave plenty of time to work on these new problems. Students should be aware that not every solution to problems that are posed in a given week use the technique that is highlighted in that week. </p>
</introduction>
<section><title>Counting Two Ways</title>
<p>Most students are familiar with formula for binomial coefficients, but in this derivation we use two-way counting.</p>
<example xml:id="ex-binomial-coeff-formula">
<statement>
<p>Derive a formula for the number of <m>k</m> element subsets of an <m>n</m> element set , <m>0\leq k\leq n</m>.</p>
</statement>
</example>

<section><title>Indirect Proofs</title>
<example><title>No Least Positive Real Number</title>
<p>Prove that there is no least positive real number.</p>
</example>
<example><title>The Harmonic Series</title><idx>Harmonic Series</idx>
<p>Students often struggle with the idea that although the terms of the harmonic series, <m>\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n}</m>, converge to zero, the series itself diverges. Encountering this fact in a calculus class in which proof may not be emphasized is often the problem.  Many of the dozens of proofs that the harmonic series diverges are indirect.  Here is one such example.</p>
<p>Assume the series converges and it's limit is <m>H</m>.
	<me>\begin{split}
		H &amp;= 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} +\cdots + \frac{1}{2k-1} + \frac{1}{2k} + \cdots\\
		&amp; \gt  \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4} +\cdots + \frac{1}{2k} + \frac{1}{2k} + \cdots\\
		&amp; = 1 + \frac{1}{2} +  +\cdots + \frac{1}{k}  + \cdots\\
		&amp; = H
		  \end{split}
	</me> 
The contradiction we arrive at, <m>H \gt H</m>, implies that the series does indeed diverge.

<exercises><title>Problems</title>

<exercise number="1">
<statement>
<p>Let <m>S</m> be a set of real numbers which is closed under multiplication (that is, if <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are in <m>S</m>, then so is <m>a b</m>). Let <m>T</m> and <m>U</m> be disjoint subsets of <m>S</m> whose union is <m>S</m>. Given that the product of any three (not necessarily distinct) elements of <m>T</m> is in <m>T</m> and that the product of any three elements of <m>U</m> is in <m>U</m>, show that at least one of the two subsets <m>T</m>, <m>U</m> is closed under multiplication.</p>
</statement>
<solution><p>Assume neither <m>T</m> nor <m>U</m> is closed.  Then there exist <m>t_1, t_2\in T</m> and <m>u_1, u_2 \in U</m> such that <m>t_1\cdot t_2 \in U</m> and <m>u_1 \cdot u_2 \in T</m>.  If we consider <m>(t_1\cdot t_2)\cdot(u_1 \cdot u_2)</m> to be a product of either three elements of <m>T</m> or <m>U</m>, meaning that it would be in the intersection, which is a contradiction.  Therefore one of the sets is closed.</p>
</solution>
</exercise>
<exercise number="2">
<statement>
<p>Let's say I have a group of <m>n+1</m> people who want to see a show. Assume they all have different ages.  I have three tickets into the theatre: a backstage pass and two regular (but distinguishable)
tickets. I have to give out the tickets according to the following two rules:
<ol>
<li>The backstage pass must go to the oldest person who gets a ticket. </li>
<li>The person who gets the backstage pass can't get either of the other two tickets, but the two normal tickets can both go to the same person.</li>
</ol>
How many ways can I give away the tickets? There are two ways to count. Find both and equate them.</p>
</statement>
<hint><p>You get two different results depending on whether you select who will be oldest first, or you decide what three people will get tickets first.</p>
</hint>

<exercise number="3">
<statement>
<p> Consider paths such as the one in the grid below that start at the bottom left, <m>(0,0),</m> and reach the top right, <m>(10,10)</m>.  These paths can only go up and to the right.  How many paths are there in all? How many of those paths pass through the point <m>(4,6)</m>?  Generalize both of your results.</p>

            </figure>
 

</statement>
<hint><p>Think of each path as a sequence of instructions to go right (R) and up (U).</p></hint>
<answer><p>There are <m>\binom{m+n}{m}</m> paths</p></answer>
<solution><p>Each path can be described as a sequence or R's and U's with exactly ten of each.   The ten positions in which R's could be placed can be selected from the twenty positions in the sequence <m>\binom{20}{10}</m> ways.  We can generalize this logic and see that there are <m>\binom{m+n}{m}</m> paths from <m>(0,0)</m> to <m>(m,n)</m>.</p>

<exercise number="4">
<statement>
<p>Prove that if <m>n\geq 1</m>, then <m>\sum _{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k}^2=\binom{2 n}{n}</m></p>

<p>Every point of three-dimensional space is colored red, green, or blue. Prove that one of the colors attains all distances, meaning that any positive real number represents the distance between two points of this color.</p>
