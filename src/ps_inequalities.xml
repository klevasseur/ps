<title>Inequalities</title>
<introduction><p>As with most topics, we could spend a whole semester on inequalities.  I normally concentrate on the relationship between the arithmetic, geometric and harmonic means, the Cauchy-Bunyakovsky-Schwarz inequality, and Young's inequality in a single class</p>
</introduction>
<section xml:id="s-means"><title>Means</title>
<idx>Arithmetic Mean</idx><idx>Geometric Mean</idx>
<p>There are many means on a finite number of nonnegative real numbers.  Here we focus on a few of the most common.  The <em>arithmetic mean</em> of <m>n</m> numbers, or what we often call their average, is their sum divided by <m>n</m>.  The <em>geometric mean</em> is computed by taking <m>n^{th}</m> root of their product.  We establish the relationship between these two means in the following theorem.
</p>
<theorem><title>The AM/GM inequality</title>
<idx>AM/GM inequality</idx>
<statement><p>Assume <m>n \geq 2</m>.  If <m>a_i</m>, <m>i = 1, 2, \dots, n</m> are non-negative real numbers, then
<me>\left(a_1 a_2\cdots  a_n\right){}^{1/n}\leq  \frac{a_1+a_2+\cdots +a_n}{n}</me>
with equality if and only if all the <m>a_i</m> are equal.</p></statement>
<proof><p>A proof by induction.  We leave the proof for <m>n=2</m> as an exercise.  Then we assume that for some <m>n \geq 2</m>, the inequality is true and then assume we have <m>n+1</m> numbers.</p> </proof>
</theorem>
<p>The AM/GM inequality can be used in optimization.  Here is an example.</p>
<example><statement><p>Problem:  If <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are positive real numbers such that <m>x+2y=1</m>, what is the largest possible value of <m>x^2 y</m>?</p>
<p>A first attempt at this problem might be to write this:
	<me>x^2 y \leq  \left( \frac{x + x + y}{3} \right)^3</me>
	However, it's <m>x+2y</m>, not <m>2x + y</m> that is invariant. The objective function needs to be adjusted with the right constants.
	<me>
	\begin{split}
		x^2 y &amp;= \frac{1}{4} \cdot x\cdot x\cdot (4 y) \\
			&amp;\leq  \frac{1}{4} \left( \frac{(2(x+2y)}{3} \right)^3\\
			&amp; = \frac{1}{4} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 = \frac{2}{27} 
			\end{split}</me>
with equality when <m>x=4y</m>, which implies that the maximum is attained when <m>y=\frac{1}{6}</m> and <m>x=\frac{2}{3}</m>.</p>
</statement>
</example>
<p>In the exercises we examine the harmonic mean and how it is related to the arithmetic and geometric means.</p>

<section><title>The CBS Inequality</title>
<p>The Cauchy-Bunyakovsky-Schwarz, or CBS, inequality has both discrete and continuous versions.  The real discrete version follows.</p>

<theorem><title>Cauchy-Bunyakovsky-Schwarz Inequality</title><idx>Cauchy-Bunyakovsky-Schwarz Inequality</idx><idx>CBS Inequality</idx>
<statement>
<p>If <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are vectors in <m>\mathbb{R}^n</m>, then  
<me>\left(\sum _{i=1}^n x_i y_i\right){}^2\leq \left(\sum _{i=1}^n x_i^2\right)\left(
\sum _{i=1}^n y_i^2\right)</me>
 with equality if and only if the two vectors are scalar multiples of one another.</p>
</statement>
<proof><p>There are many proofs of this inequality.  Here is a brief one from THE BOOK. We observe that the inequality can be express more compactly using norm and inner product notation as <m> (x, y)^2 \leq \left\Vert x \right\Vert^2 \left\Vert y \right\Vert^2 </m>. </p>
<p>We can assume that both <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are nonzero vectors, for otherwise the inequality is obvious.  Let <m>\alpha</m> be a real variable, and consider the square of the norm of the vector <m>\alpha x + y</m>.  If <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are linearly independent, then <m>\left\Vert \alpha x + y\right\Vert \gt 0</m>
<me>\begin{split}
			\left\Vert \alpha x + y \right\Vert &amp;= (\alpha x + y,\alpha x + y)\\
								&amp;  = \alpha^2 \left\Vert x \right\Vert^2 + 2 \alpha (x, y) + \left\Vert y \right\Vert
	\end{split}
</me>
This quadratic polynomial in <m>\alpha</m> has no real roots and so the discriminant, <m>4 (x, y)^2 - 4\left\Vert x \right\Vert^2 \left\Vert y \right\Vert^2 \lt 0</m>, which implies CBS.</p>
<p>If  <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are linearly dependent, we get equality since the discriminant would equal zero.</p>
</proof>
</theorem>

<section><title>Young's Inequality</title>
<p>Given positive numbers  and  whose reciprocals add up to one, the product  of two positive real numbers  and  is less than or equal to a weighted sum of <m>p^{th}</m> and <m>q^{th}</m> powers  of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>.
</p>
<theorem>
	<title>Young's inequality</title>
	<idx>Young's inequality</idx>
		<statement><p>If <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are nonnegative real numbers and <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> are positive real numbers such that <m>\frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{q} = 1</m>, then 
		<me>a\cdot b \leq \frac{a^{p}}{p} + \frac{b^{q}}{q}.</me></p></statement>
<proof><p>The proof follows from the following more general inequality, where <m>f(x)=x^{p-1}</m>.
</p> </proof>
</theorem>
<theorem>
	<title>__</title>
	<idx>__</idx>
		<statement><p>If <m>f</m> is a strictly increasing function on the positive real numbers, <m>f(0)=0</m>, and <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are positive real numbers, then 
		<me>a b \leq \int_0^a f(x) \, dx +\int_0^b f^{-1}(y) \, dy</me></p></statement>
<proof><p>If <m>b=f(a)</m>, then the rectangle <m>[0,a]\times[0,b]</m> is divided into two regions, the region below the curve <m>y=f(x)</m>, and the region to the left of <m>x = f^{-1}(y)</m>.  The sum of the two integrals is exactly equal to the area, <m>a\cdot b</m>.  If <m>f(a) \gt b</m>, the region whose area  <m>\int_0^b f^{-1}(y) \, dy</m> computes is contained within the rectangle, but the region whose area <m>\int_0^a f(x) \, dx</m> computes spills outside the rectangle, making the inequality a strict one.  This case is illustrated by <xref ref="figure-young" />.  In the other case, where <m>f(a) \lt b</m>, the excess area that makes the inequality a strict one is accounted for by <m>\int_0^b f^{-1}(y) \, dy</m>.
</p> </proof>
