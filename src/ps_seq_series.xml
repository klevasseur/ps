<section><title>The Fibonacci sequence</title>
<idx>Fibonacci sequence</idx>
<p>The Fibonacci sequence is defined by  <m>f_0=1</m>, <m>f_1= 1</m>, and for <m>n\geq 2</m>, <m>f_n= f_{n-2}+f_{n-1}</m>.
Warm-up  Prove that any two consecutive Fibonacci numbers are coprime.  Note:  the terms  <q>coprime</q>  and   <q>relatively prime</q> mean the same thing, have no common factor other than 1.

<section><title>Telescoping Series</title>
<p>There are relatively few types of series for which sums are well know.  Geometric series is one of them, and another is <em>telescoping series</em>.  If a problem asks for the exact value of a series, not just whether it converges, it's a good strategy to see if it's either geometric or telescoping. </p>
<p>A telescoping series (sometimes called a retracting series) look something like this:  <me>(a_1-a_2)+(a_2-a_3)+(a_3-a_4)+\cdots</me>
Notice that if this sum is infinite and the <m>a_i</m> converge to zero, everything cancels except <m>a_1</m>. More precisely, the partial sums are of the form <m>a_1-a_{n+1}</m>, which converge to <m>a_1</m>.  If it's finite and stops at <m>a_{n-1}-a_n</m>, then the sum is <m>a_{1}-a_n</m>.  There are variations on this form where cancellation occurs differently, in a telescoping series, massive cancellation occurs.</p>
<p>Next, we find the value of an infinite series by identifying it as telescoping.</p>
<example>
<p>Express <m>\sum _{k=1}^{\infty } \frac{6^k}{\left(3^{k+1}-2^{k+1}\right) \left(3^k-2^k\right)}</m> as a rational number.</p>
<p>The solution, by Rebecca Mendum, not only identifies the telescoping of terms, but is a good example of using auxiliary notation to simplify expressions.  We start by letting <m>2^k=x</m> and <m>3^k=y</m> and first work with the general term of the sum:
<me>\begin{split}
\frac{6^k}{(3^{k+1}-2^{k+1})(3^k-2^k)}&amp;=\frac{x y}{(3y-2x)(y-x)}\\
	&amp;=\frac{A}{3x-2x} + \frac{B}{y-x}
\end{split}
</me>
For the purposes of this partial fractions decomposition, we imagine <m>y</m> to be our variable and think of <m>x</m> as a constant. With this assumption, we get <m>A=-2x</m> and <m>B=x</m>. Our sum becomes
<me>
\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{A}{3x-2x} + \frac{B}{y-x}
    =\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{2^k}{3^k-2^k} - \frac{2^{k+1}}{3^{k+1}-2^{k+1}}
</me>
If we let <m>t(j)=\frac{2^j}{3^j-2^j}</m> then this series is easily identified as telescoping:
<me>\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{2^k}{3^k-2^k} - \frac{2^{k+1}}{3^{k+1}-2^{k+1}}=(t(1)-t(2))+(t(2)-t(3))+(t(3)-t(4))+\cdots</me>
and the sum convergees to <m>t(1)=2</m> since <m>\lim_{k\rightarrow \infty} t(k)=0</m></p>
</example>

<section><title>Generating Functions</title>
<idx>Counting Binary Trees</idx>
<p>Students should know how to derive the power series representation of a function, but might not be familiar with the inverse process of identifying  a function, given its power series.   This is a particulary powerful tool for deriving a formula from a combinitorial sequence. We will illustrate this technique by deriving a formula for the number of different binary trees with <m>n</m> vertices.</p>
<definition xml:id="def-binary-tree"><title>Binary Tree</title>
<idx>Binary Tree</idx>
<statement>
<p><ol marker="(1)">
<li><p>A tree consisting of no vertices (the empty tree) is a binary tree</p></li>
<li><p>A vertex together with two subtrees that are both binary trees is a binary tree. The subtrees are called the left and right subtrees of the binary tree.</p></li>
</ol></p>
</statement></definition>
<p>Let <m>B(n)</m> be the number of different binary trees of size <m>n</m> (<m>n</m> vertices), <m>n \geq  0</m>. By our definition of a binary tree,
<m>B(0) = 1</m>. Our first step in developing a formula for <m>B(n)</m> will be to derive a formula for its generating function, <m>G(z)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} B(n)z^n</m> </p>
<p>Consider any positive integer <m>n + 1</m>, <m>n \geq  0</m>. A binary tree of size <m>n + 1</m> has two subtrees, the sizes of which add
up to <m>n</m>. The possibilities can be broken down into <m>n + 1</m> cases:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Case 0: Left subtree has size 0; right subtree has size <m>n</m>. </p>
<p>Case 1: Left subtree has size 1; right subtree has size <m>n - 1</m>.</p>
<p> <m>\quad \quad </m><m>\vdots</m></p>
<p>Case <m>k</m>: Left subtree has size <m>k</m>; right subtree has size <m>n - k</m>.</p>
<p> <m>\quad \quad </m><m>\vdots</m></p>
<p>Case <m>n</m>: Left subtree has size <m>n</m>; right subtree has size 0.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We can count the number of possibilities by multiplying the number of ways that the left subtree can be filled, <m>B(k)</m>, by the number of ways that the right subtree can be filled, <m>B(n-k)</m>. Since the sum of these products equals <m>B(n + 1)</m>, we obtain the recurrence relation for <m>n\geq 0</m>:


<me>
\begin{split}
 B(n+1) &amp;= B(0)B(n)+ B(1)B(n-1)+ \cdots  + B(n)B(0)\\
 		&amp;=\sum_{k=0}^n B(k) B(n-k)
\end{split} </me>
</p>

<p>Think of each side of the recurrence relation as term of a sequence and take the generating function of both sides:
<mdn><mrow xml:id="eq-bin-gf">\sum_{n=0}^{\infty } B(n+1) z^n= \sum_{n=0}^{\infty }  \left(\sum_{k=0}^n B(k) B(n-k)\right)z^n</mrow></mdn>
</p>
<p>The left side of <xref ref="eq-bin-gf"/> is  <m>\frac{G(z)-B(0)}{z}=\frac{G(z)-1}{z}</m>. The right side is the square of <m>G(z)</m>. Therefore,
<me>\frac{G(z)-1}{z}= G(z)^2  \Rightarrow  z G(z)^2- G(z) + 1 = 0</me>
Using the quadratic equation we find two solutions:
<mdn><mrow>G_1(z) = \frac{1+\sqrt{1-4 z}}{2z} \textrm{ and}</mrow>
<mrow> G_2(z) = \frac{1-\sqrt{1-4 z}}{2z}</mrow></mdn>
</p>
<p>It is apparent that <m>G_1(z)</m> is not what we are looking for because it has a singularity at <m>z=0</m> while the <m>G(z)</m> we are looking for satisfies <m>G(0)=1</m>. <m>G_2(z)</m> does statisfy the condition at zero and so we will expand it to extract its coefficients.  We can compute the first few coefficients numerically to verify that we are on the right track


<mdn><mrow>G_2(x) = 1+z+2 z^2+5 z^3+14 z^4+42 z^5+\cdots</mrow></mdn>
It's easy to verify that these coefficient satisfy our recurrence relation.  So now we will develop a general expression for <m>B(n)</m> using the generalized binomial theorem.</p>
<p>
<me>
\begin{split}
G(z) &amp;= \frac{1-\sqrt{1-4 z}}{2z}\\
		&amp;= \frac{1 - \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \binom{\frac{1}{2}}{n} (-4z)^n}{2z}\\
		&amp;= \frac{-1}{2} \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \binom{\frac{1}{2}}{n} (-4)^n z^{n-1}\\
		&amp;= \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{-1}{2} \binom{\frac{1}{2}}{n+1} (-4)^{n+1} z^n
\end{split}
</me> 
</p>
<p>We leave it as an exercise to verify that
<me>B(n) =\frac{-1}{2} \binom{\frac{1}{2}}{n+1} (-4)^{n+1}= \frac{1}{n+1}\left(
\begin{array}{c}
 2n \\
 n \\
\end{array}
\right)</me>

<p>Let <m>X_n</m> be the base 10 integer with a representation of <m>2n</m> <m>4</m>'s, and <m>Y_n</m> the base 10 integer with a representation of <m>n</m> <m>6</m>'s.  We will prove that <m>\lfloor \sqrt{X_n} \rfloor = Y_n</m>.  First notice that <m>X_n</m> is an <m>n</m> term geometric series with initial term <m>44</m> and ratio <m>100</m> and so it has the sum <m>X_n = \frac{4}{9} \dot (100^n-1)</m>.</p>

which has as its floor <m>Y_n</m>.  We verify that the difference between <m>\sqrt{X_n + \frac{4}{9}}</m> and <m>\sqrt{X_n}</m> is never large enough to make a difference in their floors:

<li><p>If <m>S(n)</m> is the number of ways to tile a <m>2 \times  n</m> rectangle, then <m>S(1)=1</m>, <m>S(2)=2</m>, and for <m>n \geq 2</m>, <m>S(n)=S(n-1)+S(n-2)</m>.  Therefore, <m>S</m> is a shifted Fibonacci sequence. </p></li>

See The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences entry for this sequence: <url href="https://oeis.org/A001835" visual="oeis.org/A001835"/></p>
<p>The derivation of the recursion for this case is based on looking for the first <q>fault line</q> in tiling. If you align the rectangle with the three units in the vertical direction, a fault line any vertical line that doesn't pass through a tile.   If you scan across the rectangle in some predetermined order, suppose that the  first fault line is <m>2 k</m> units into the scan, <m>1\leq k \leq n</m>. Note that a fault line can't occur an odd number of units from the start of the scan.  If <m>k=1</m>, there are three ways to arrange tiles in the first <m>2</m> columns and <m>T(n-1)</m> ways to finish up.  If <m>k \gt 1</m> then the are only two different arrangements of the first <m>2k</m> columns, and <m>T(n-k)</m> ways to finish up the tiling.   Therefore we have the recursion
