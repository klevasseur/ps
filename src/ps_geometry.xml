<title>Geometry</title>
<introduction>
<p>There are three basic approaches to geometric problems:
<ol label="(1)">
<li><p>Axiomatic approach, where everything is deduced from basic facts, such as congruence tests for triangles (SAS, ASA, and SSS), similarity of triangles,
angles in the circle theorem, etc. These problems are good practice, but you are unlikely to see them on the Putnam exam.</p></li>
<li><p> Method of coordinates. Points on the plane are interpreted as coordinates <m>(x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2</m>, or vectors, or complex numbers. Calculations
can often be simplified by using basic linear algebra (scalar products, etc.) and knowing geometric interpretations of various algebraic operations
(e.g. multiplication of complex numbers). Alternatively, a lot of things can be computed using trig functions.</p></li>
<li><p> Symmetries and transformations. This is a more dynamic approach, where you apply and compose rotations, symmetries, etc.</p></li>
</ol>
Often, problems are only formulated using geometric language but the solution uses some counting trick, or combinatorics, etc.</p>

<statement>
<p>What convex quadrilaterals can be inscribed into a circle? There is a name for these quadrilaterals, but your answer should describe them, not
just name them</p>

<exercise>
<statement>
<p>Prove that if the lengths of the sides of a triangle form an arithmetic progression, then the radius of the inscribed circle is one third of one
of the heights of the triangle.</p>
</statement>
<!-- 
<hint><p></p></hint>
 -->
<solution><p>Assume the sides of the triangle are <m>b-d</m>, <m>b</m>, and <m>b+d</m>; and that the altitude to the side of length <m>b</m> is <m>h</m>. Let <m>r</m> be the radius of the inscribed circle.  If we connect the center of the inscribed circle to the vertices of the triangle, the area of the triangle is the sum of areas of three triangles with height <m>r</m> the sides of the triangles as bases.  Therefore,
<me> \frac{1}{2} b \cdot h = \frac{1}{2} r(b-d)+ \frac{1}{2} r\cdot b+ \frac{1}{2} r(b+d) = \frac{1}{2}r(3\cdot b) = \frac{1}{2}b(3\cdot r)</me>
Therefore, <m>r=\frac{1}{3}\cdot b</m></p></solution>
