<introduction><p>Mathematical games are a common type of problem in the Putnam. The two most recent cases have been difficult, A5 in 2017 and B5 in 2014.</p>
</introduction><section>
<title>Examples</title>
<p>
In analyzing games, it is  always assumed that players use optimal strategies, i. e., they make rational moves in their best interests.</p>

<p>Some games cannot really be played in that they would require an infinite number of moves. Other game-related problems ask a long term strategy, such as the following, where playing the game once might not really help.</p>

<statement><p>
This game starts with three piles of stones. The piles contain 5, 7, and 11 stones. Two players take turns. On each turn, a player
must remove at least one stone, and may remove any number of stones provided they all come from the same pile. The goal is to be the last player
to take a stone. What player has a definite winning strategy; i. e. will always win if he/she makes the right moves.
</p></statement>
<hint><p>Look closely at these two positions: two piles of three stones, or three piles with three, two and one stone.   These are both losing positions for the next player for the same reason.</p></hint>

A line of squares is laid out starting with square 1, then square 2 to its right, square 3 further right, etc.  The number of squares can be as long as you like. Put some coins in some of the squares.  For example.  one on square 1, two on square 3, one on square 5, and one on square 6.  Take turns moving one coin to the left. There are no restrictions otherwise. You can jump onto or over other coins, or jump clear off the line. You can have any number of coins on a square. Your aim is to be the person who makes the last move.

Two players play the following game. They start with two piles of candy, one with 21 and the other with 20 candies. At each turn, a player eats one of the piles and splits the other into two piles. The first player who can't make a legal move loses. Who will win, the first player or the second
player?
</p></statement>
<hint><p>If you leave our opponent with two <q>piles</q> with one candy each, you win.</p></hint>

Two players play the following game. Start with the equation
           <me>\_ x^3 + \_ x^2 + \_ x + \_= 0</me>
The players take turns writing real numbers instead of blanks. The first player wins if the resulting cubic equation has exactly one real solution; otherwise he loses. Does either player have a winning strategy?
</p></statement>
<!-- 
<hint><p></p></hint>
 -->
<solution><p>We identify the blanks, from left to right as a, b, c and d.  Player 2 will always win using the following strategy.</p>
<p>We pair up the blanks  a and c, and b and d.   Whatever blank Player 1 fills, Player 2 should fill in the other blank in the pair with the negation of the number Player 1 used.  For example, if Player fills blank c with a 2, Player 2 should fill blank a with -2.  After four turns, the result is 
	<me>s x^3 + t x^2 - s x - t =  (x^2-1)(s x + t) =0</me> 
which always has 3 real solutions if both <m>s</m>  and <m>t</m> are nonzero.   If any combination of  <m>s</m>  and <m>t</m> are zero, it's easy to see that the number of real solutions is not 1.</p>

Consider the following game played with a deck of <m>2n</m> cards numbered from 1 to <m>2n</m>. The deck is randomly shuffled and <m>n</m> cards are dealt
to each of two players. Beginning with A, the players take turns discarding one of their remaining cards and announcing its number. The game ends
as soon as the sum of the numbers on the discarded cards is divisible by <m>2n + 1</m>. The last person to discard wins the game. Assuming optimal strategy
by both A and B, what is the probability that A wins?

<statement><p>
 Alice and Bob play a game in which they take turns removing stones from a heap that initially has <m>n</m> stones. The number of stones removed at each turn must be one less than a prime. The winner is the player who takes the last stone. Alice plays first. Prove that there are infinitely many <m>n</m> such that Bob has a winning strategy.
</p></statement>
<!-- 
<hint><p></p></hint>
 -->
<solution><p>Assume Bob has only a finite set of initial pile sizes for which he wins, <m>B={n_1,n_2, \dots, n_M}</m>, where <m>N=max(n_i)</m>.  This means that for every <m>n \notin B</m>, Alice can leave Bob with a number of stones in <m>B</m>.
<me>
\begin{split}
	n \notin B &amp; \Rightarrow  n = n_k + (p-1)  \textrm{  for some prime }p\\
	 &amp;  n-p \lt N
\end{split}
</me>
Therefore, for all <m>n</m>, <m>n</m> differs from a prime by a some bounded value.  Since there are arbitrarily long runs of non-primes, this is a contradiction. </p></solution>

In  Determinant Tic-Tac-Toe, Player 1 enters a 1 in an empty 3 $\times $ 3 matrix. Player 0 counters with a 0 in a vacant position, and play
continues in turn until the <m>3 \times  3</m> matrix is completed with five 1's and four 0's. Player 0 wins if the determinant is 0 and player 1
wins otherwise. Assuming both players pursue optimal strategies, who will win and how?

  Alice and Barbara play a game with a pack of <m>2n</m> cards, on each of which is written a positive integer. The pack is shuffled and the
cards laid out in a row, with the numbers facing upwards. Alice starts, and the girls take turns to remove one card from either end of the row, until Barbara picks up the final card. Each girl's score is the sum of the numbers on her chosen cards at the end of the game.  Is either player sure to win?
</p></statement>
<!-- 
<hint><p></p></hint>
 -->
<solution><p>Alice is sure to win if the sum of the card values in odd positions in the line differs from the sum on even positions. If that is the case, assume the odd positions have a higher sum.  Alice will win by choosing the card in position 1.  Barbara is forced to choose a card in an even position and then Alice can take a card from the exposed odd position.  By continuing in this way, Alice will get all the cards in odd positions and win.  There are some initial configurations where the game will end in a tie.  For example, if <m>n=1</m> the line of cards <m> 2,1,3,4</m> will produce a tie.</p></solution>

A game is played as follows. The first player selects an interval [a, b]. The second player selects an interval <m>[c, d] \subset  [a, b]</m>. The first
player selects an interval inside <m>[c, d]</m>, and so on. The game goes on forever. The first player will win if the intersection of all segments contains a rational number. Is he going to win?
</p></statement>
<hint><p>One player makes a list of rational numbers in \([a,b]\) and plan to avoid them sequentially.</p></hint>
