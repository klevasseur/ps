<p>Groups and finite fields are among the topics that have made their way into the Putnam lately.</p>
</introduction>
<section>
<title>Groups</title>

<p>Let <m>G</m> be a group. Recall that the order of  <m>g \in G</m> is the minimum positive integer <m>k</m> such that <m>g^k</m> is the group identity.</p>
<example><title>1969 Putnam, altered</title>
<p>Show that a group cannot be the union of two of its proper subgroups.</p>
<p>Assume <m>H</m> and <m>K</m> are subgroups of some group <m>G</m>, and that <m>x \in H-K</m>, <m>y \in K-H</m>.  We know that <m>x*y</m> must be in either <m>H</m> or <m>K</m>.  Assume it's in <m>H</m>.
<me>x \in H \Rightarrow x^{-1} \in H \Rightarrow x^{-1}*(x*y) = y \in H</me>
This contradiction implies that no such pair of subgroups exists.</p>

<title>Rings and Fields</title>
<p>Problem: Assume that <m>p(x)</m> is a polynomial of degree <m>n</m> over a field <m>F</m> that has <m>n</m> distinct roots in <m>F</m>. Let <m>I=(p(x)) = \{s(x)p(x) \mid s(x)\in F[x]\}</m> be the principle ideal generated by <m>p(x)</m>.  Characterize the factor ring <m>F[x]/I</m>.</p>

<p>Assume 
	<me>p(x)= \prod_{k=1}^n (x-\alpha_k),</me>
where the <m>\alpha_k</m>'s are distinct elements of <m>F</m>.
We can show that <m>F[x]/I</m> is isomorphic to the ring <m>F^n</m> of <m>n</m>-tuples of elements of <m>F</m> with coordinatewise operations over <m>F</m>.  Define <m>\phi:F[x]/I \rightarrow F^n</m> by 
<me>\phi(r(x)+I)=(r(\alpha_1),r(\alpha_2),\dots,r(\alpha_n))</me> </p>
<p>We leave it to the reader to verify that <m>\phi</m> is an isomorphism by checking the following: 
<ul>
<li><p><m>\phi</m> is well defined.</p></li>
<li><p>For all <m>r(x)+I, s(x)+I  \in F[x]/I</m>:<me>\phi((r(x)+I)+(s(x)+I))= \phi(r(x)+I)+\phi(s(x)+I)</me>  </p></li>
<li><p>For all <m>r(x)+I, s(x)+I  \in F[x]/I</m>:<me>\phi((r(x)+I)\cdot (s(x)+I))= \phi(r(x)+I)\cdot \phi(s(x)+I)</me>  </p></li>
</ul>

<title>Exercises</title>
<exercise number="1">
<statement>
<p>Let <m>S</m> be a set which is closed under the binary operation <m>\circ</m>, with the following properties:
<ul>
<li><p>There is an element <m>e \in S</m> such that <m>a \circ e = e\circ a=a, \forall a\in S</m></p></li>
<li><p> <m>(a \circ b) \circ (c \circ d) = (a \circ c) \circ (b \circ d) \forall a,b,c,d \in  S</m>.</p></li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Prove or disprove:
<ol>
<li><p> <m> \circ</m>  is associative on <m>S</m></p></li>
<li><p> <m> \circ</m>  is commutative on S</p></li>
</ol>

<exercise number="2">
<statement>
<p>Let <m>*</m> be an associative binary operation on a set <m>A</m> such that for all <m>a, b \in A</m>, <m>a*b=b*a \Rightarrow a=b</m>.  Prove that for all <m>a, b, c \in A</m>, <m>a*b*c = a*c</m>.</p>
</statement>
<!-- 
<hint><p></p></hint>
 -->
<solution>
<p>Step 1: Note that the operation must be idempotent.  By associativity, <m>(a*a)*a = a*(a*a)</m>, and so <m>a*a=a</m>.</p>	
<p>Step 2: Show that for all <m>a, b</m>, <m> a*b*a=a</m>:		 
	<me>\begin{split}
	(a*b*a)*a &amp;= (a*b)*(a*a)\\
			&amp;=(a*b*a)\\
			&amp;=((a*a)*b*a)\\
			&amp;= a*(a*b*a) \Rightarrow a*b*a = a
	\end{split}
	</me></p>
<p>Step 3: Prove that <m>a*b*c=a*c</m>.
<me>(a*b*c)*(a*c)= (a*(b*c)*a)*c = a*c</me>
while
<me>(a*c)(a*b*c)= a*(c*(a*c)*c)= a*c</me>
hence the conclusion.</p>
</solution>
</exercise>
<exercise number="3">
<statement>
<p>(Putnam 1972) Let <m>S</m> be a set and <m></m> a binary operation on <m>S</m> satisfying the laws
<ol marker="(i)">
<li><p><m> x(xy)=y</m> for all <m>x,y \in S</m></p></li>
<li><p><m> (yx)x=y</m> for all <m>x,y \in S</m></p></li>
</ol>
Show that <m>*</m> is commutative but not necessarily associative.</p>
</statement>
<solution>
<p>Step 1: Show that <m>x*(y*x)=(x*y)*x = y</m> for all <m>x,y \in S</m>
	<me>\begin{split}
		y &amp;=(y*(y*x))*(y*x)\\
			&amp;=x*(y*x)
			\end{split}</me>
and we can get <m>(x*y)*x</m>	similarly.  Combining these equalities with the two given ones, we see that the product of three factors with one pair of equal ones can be commuted and associated in any order and the result is the unique factor.</p>
<p>Step 2: We can now get commutivity:		 
	<me>\begin{split}
	y*x &amp;= (x*(y*x))*x\\
			&amp;=x*((y*x)*x)\\
			&amp;=x*y
	\end{split}
	</me></p>
<p>We haven't used general associativity here, and in fact there are nonassociative binary operations that satisfy the premises. One such is the operation on the integers defined by <m>x*y = -(x+y)</m>.</p>
</solution>
</exercise>

<exercise>
<statement>
<p>Let <m>G</m> be a finite group with identity <m>e</m>.  If <m>G</m> contains distinct elements <m>g</m> and <m>h</m>, neither equal to <m>e</m>, such that
<me>g^5=e \textrm{  and  }g h g^{-1} = h^2,</me>
determine the order of <m>h</m>.
</p>
</statement>
<solution>
<p>  Start with <m>g^2 h (g^{-1})^{2}</m> and note that it reduces to <m>h^4</m>.  Repeat with <m>g^3</m> replacing <m>g^2</m> and continue the pattern to conclude that <m>h^{32}=h</m>.  This implies that <m>h^{31}=e</m> and since 31 is prime the order of <m>h</m> must be 31.</p>
</solution>

<exercise><idx>Symmetric Group</idx>
<statement>
<p>In abstract algebra, the symmetric group <m>S_n</m> is the group of all permutations on <m>\{1, 2, \dots, n\}</m>; i. e., bijections on <m>\{1, 2, \dots, n\}</m>.  A transposition in <m>S_n</m> is a function <m>\tau</m> such that <m>\tau(i)=j</m> and <m>\tau(j)=i</m>, where <m>i \neq j</m> and <m>\tau(k)=k</m> for <m>k \neq i, j</m>.  A fundamental theorem involving permutations (which we will take as given) is that every permutation is a composition of an even number of transpositions or  an odd number of transpositions, but not both.   Prove that exactly half of the elements of <m>S_n</m> are <q>even.</q>

<exercise>
<statement>
<p>Consider the puzzle below, where one can rotate each of the three triangles. For example, rotating the middle triangle in (A) once gives the configuration in (B).

                </image>
            </figure>

</statement>
<solution>
<p>Every 120 degree spin of a triangle is an even permutation of the vertices. Therefore, any configuration that is reached starting at (A) must be even.  The configuration we are asked to consider is a single transposition of the vertices 1 and 2, which is an odd permutation. </p>
