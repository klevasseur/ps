<title>Tricks of the Trade </title>
<introduction>
<p>In this chapter we highlight some <q>tricks of the trade</q> that can help you piece together a solution to many problems.  Naturally, no single trick is likely to be needed in a given competition, but all of them have been played a part in solving some problems in past competitions.</p>
</introduction>
<section>
<title>Completing the Product</title>
<p>The elementary trick of completing the square, given a quadratic and linear term, can be generalized.  Given three terms, completing the product of two binomials can play a part in a solution.  This occured in the 2018 Putnam, problem A1.</p> 
<blockquote><p>Find all ordered pairs <m>(a,b)</m> of positive integers for which
<me>
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} = \frac{3}{2018}.
</me>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Elementary algebra leads to 
<me>3ab-2018(a+b)=0</me>
By distributing the 2018 we have three terms.  Multiplying by 3 and adding <m>2018^2</m> to both sides completes a product of two binomial factors on the the left side:
<me>(3a-2018)(3b-2018) = 2018^2.</me></p>
<p>From the Putnam Archive:</p>
<blockquote><p>With this equation, we can identify solutions the original equation in the positive integers. Each of the factors is congruent to <m>1 \pmod 3</m>. There are <m>6</m> positive factors of <m>2018^2 = 2^2 \cdot 1009^2</m> that are congruent to <m>1 \pmod 3</m>: <m>1</m>, <m>2^2</m>, <m>1009</m>, <m>2^2 \cdot 1009</m>, <m>1009^2</m>, <m>2^2 \cdot 1009^2</m>. These lead to the <m>6</m> possible pairs: <m>(a,b) = (673,1358114)</m>, <m>(674,340033)</m>, <m>(1009,2018)</m>, <m>(2018,1009)</m>, <m>(340033,674)</m>, and <m>(1358114,673)</m>.</p>

<p>As for negative factors, the ones that are congruent to <m>1 \pmod 3</m> are <m>-2, -2 \cdot 1009, -2 \cdot 1009^2</m>.  However, all of these lead to pairs where <m>a \leq 0</m> or <m>b \leq 0</m>.</p></blockquote>

<title>Trig Substitution</title>
<p>When a real numbers have absolute value less than or equal to 1, consider equating them with cosines or sines.   Here is an example from the 2000 Putnam, Problem B4.</p>

<example xml:id="ex-2000Putnam"><title>2000 Putnam, B4</title>
<p>Let <m>f:[−1,1]\rightarrow \mathbb{R}</m> be a continuous function such that <m>f(2x^2−1)=2xf(x)</m> for all <m>x</m>. Show that <m>f(x)=0</m> for <m>-1 \leq x \leq 1</m>.</p>
<p>Solution: Substitution of 1 and -1 for <m>x</m> produces <m>f(1)=f(-1)=0</m>.</p>
<p>The restriction on <m>x</m> and the expression <m>2 x^2 -1</m> may remind one of the identity <m>1-\cos{x}^2 = \cos{2 x}</m>; and so the substitution <m>x = \cos{t}</m> is a reasonable step leading to <m>f(\cos{2t})=2 \cos{t} f(\cos{t})</m>.</p>
<p>The next step in several published solutions is to define a second function, <m>g</m>, by
 <me>g(t)=\frac{f(\cos{t})}{\sin{t}}, \textrm{ where } t\neq \pi k, k\in \mathbb{Z}</me>
 A <q>meta exercises</q> is to provide a motivation for this definition</p>
<p><me>g(2t)=\frac{f(\cos{2t})}{\sin{2t}}=\frac{\cos{t}\: f(\cos{t})}{2\sin{t}\cos{t}}=g(t)</me>
Combining this with the periodicity of <m>g</m> tells us that
<me>g(1+\frac{n \pi}{2^k})=g(2^{k+1}+2 \pi n) = g(2^{k+1})=g(1)</me>
The continuity of <m>g</m> in its domain and the density of <m>{1+\frac{n \pi}{2^k} \mid n,k \in \mathbb{Z}}</m> implies that <m>g</m> must be constant.</p>
<p>Returning our attention to <m>f</m> we have <m>f(\cos{t})= c \sin{t}</m> for some constant <m>c</m>, which implies <m>f(x) = c \sqrt{1-x^2}</m> for <m>x \in (-1,1)</m>.  Finally, this tells us that <m>f</m> must be even.  However, when we turn to the original fuctional equation,
 <m>x f(x)=f(2x^2-1)</m> we have an odd function on the left and an even function on the right.  our only possibility is the desired conclusion.</p>
</example>
<!-- <blockquote><p>Given a real number <m>a</m>, we define a sequence by <m>x_0 = 1</m>, <m>x_1 = x_2 = a</m>, and <m>x_{n+1} = 2x_n x_{n-1} - x_{n-2}</m> for <m>n \geq 2</m>. Prove that if <m>x_n = 0</m> for some <m>n</m>, then the sequence is periodic.</p></blockquote> -->

<title>Generalization</title>
<p>Many mainstream topics in the mathematics curriculum can be generalized. One example is the binomial expansion.  The expansion of <m>(x+y)^n</m> for nonnegative integers is in every curriculum, but it's generalization for non-integral exponents is not. 
</p>
<example><title>Fractional Binomial Expansion</title><idx>Fractional Binomial Expansion</idx>
<p>The power series series expansion about <m>x=0</m> of an expression such as <m>\sqrt{1-x}</m> certainly can be derived using basic calculus tools, but an alternate approach can be taken by (correctly) assuming that the binomial expansion theorem applies for the exponent <m>\frac{1}{2}</m>.  The integral version is finite since <m>\binom{m}{n} =0</m> for <m>n \gt m</m>, but a reasonable generalization of <m>\binom{\alpha}{n}</m> is <me>\frac{\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} (\alpha-k)}{n!}</me> which will never equal zero for non-integral values of <m>\alpha</m>.  Thus we have 
	<me>\sqrt{1-x} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \binom{\frac{1}{2}}{n} (-x)^n</me>
The first two terms of this sum are 1 and <m>-\frac{1}{2} x</m>. We will preceed to simplify the general form of the coefficient of <m>x^n</m> for <m>n \gt 1</m>.
<me>	
	\begin{split}
	 \binom{\frac{1}{2}}{n} (-1)^n
				&amp;=  \frac{\frac{1}{2} \cdot\frac{-1}{2}\cdot\frac{-3}{2}\cdot \cdots \cdot(\frac{1}{2}-(n-1)) }{n!} (-1)^n\\
\textrm{multiply fractions by 2 }	&amp;=  \frac{1 \cdot -1 \cdot -3 \cdot \cdots \cdot (-2n+3)}{2^{n} n!} (-1)^n\\
\textrm{multiply negatives by factors of -1}	&amp;= - \frac{1 \cdot 1 \cdot 3 \cdot \cdots \cdot (2n-3)}{2^{n} n!}  \\
\textrm{fill in even and higher factors of }(2n!)	&amp;= - \frac{ 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3\cdot 4 \cdot \cdots \cdot (2n-3)\cdot (2n-2)\cdot (2n-1)\cdot (2n)}{2^n\cdot 2^n\cdot (n!)^2 \cdot (2n-1)}  \\
\textrm{(put things together)}	&amp;= - \frac{(2n)!}{4^n \cdot(n!)^2\cdot (2n-1)} 
	\end{split}</me>
This general formula actually works for all <m>n</m>, including 0 and 1.   Thus,
<me>\sqrt{1-x}  = - \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(2n)!}{4^n \cdot(n!)^2\cdot (2n-1)}  x^n  </me>	
	
</p>
</example>
<remark><p><idx>Pochhammer symbol</idx> The Pochhammer symbol is the notation  <m>(x)_n</m>, where <m>n</m> is a non-negative integer. It is commonly used to represent the <q>falling factorial</q> expression  <m>x\cdot(x-1)\cdot(x-2)\cdot \cdots \cdot (x-(k-1))</m>.  This gives a more concise way to express the expansion we have just examined as <m>\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(\frac{1}{2})_n}{n!} (-x)^n</m>.  However, you still need to get into the weeds and manipulate the expression in the end. </p></remark>
<p>A different sense in which generalization applies to problem solving is when a problem is more easily solved by first generalizing the context of the problem.  This problem from the 1982 Putnam is a good example.</p>
<example xml:id="example-putnam-integral"><title>A Putnam Integral</title>
<p>Evaluate <m>\int_0^{\infty} \frac{\tan ^{-1}(\pi  x)-\tan ^{-1}(x)}{x} \, dx</m>.</p>
<p>The integral can be evaluated by generalizing it first to a function: 
<m>F(y)=\int_0^{\infty} \frac{\tan ^{-1}(y x)-\tan ^{-1}(x)}{x} \, dx</m>. We then can differentiate with respect to <m>y</m> to get a simple expression of <m>F(y)</m>.  After applying the obvious condition <m>F(1)=0</m>, we can substitute <m>\pi</m> for <m>y</m> to get our final answer.  We leave it as an exercise for you to get the final answer of <m>\frac{1}{2} \pi  \ln(\pi )</m></p>
