<title>Tricks of the Trade </title>
<introduction>
<p>In this chapter we highlight some <q>tricks of the trade</q> that can help you piece together a solution to many problems.  Naturally, no single trick is likely to be needed in a given competition, but all of them have been played a part in solving some problems in past competitions.</p>

<title>Completing the Product</title>
<p>The elementary trick of completing the square, given a quadratic and linear term, can be generalized.  Given three terms, completing the product of two binomials can play a part in a solution.  This occured in the 2018 Putnam, problem A1.  
<blockquote>Find all ordered pairs <m>(a,b)</m> of positive integers for which
<me>
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} = \frac{3}{2018}.
</me>
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>Elementary algebra leads to 
<me>3ab-2018(a+b)=0</me>
By distributing the 2018 we have three terms.  Multiplying by 3 and adding <m>2018^2</m> to both sides completes a product of two binomial factors on the the left side:
<me>(3a-2018)(3b-2018) = 2018^2.</me></p>
<p>From the Putnam Archive:
<blockquote><p>With this equation, we can identify solutions the original equation in the positive integers. Each of the factors is congruent to <m>1 \pmod 3</m>. There are <m>6</m> positive factors of <m>2018^2 = 2^2 \cdot 1009^2</m> that are congruent to <m>1 \pmod 3</m>: <m>1</m>, <m>2^2</m>, <m>1009</m>, <m>2^2 \cdot 1009</m>, <m>1009^2</m>, <m>2^2 \cdot 1009^2</m>. These lead to the <m>6</m> possible pairs: <m>(a,b) = (673,1358114)</m>, <m>(674,340033)</m>, <m>(1009,2018)</m>, <m>(2018,1009)</m>, <m>(340033,674)</m>, and <m>(1358114,673)</m>.</p>

<p>As for negative factors, the ones that are congruent to <m>1 \pmod 3</m> are <m>-2, -2 \cdot 1009, -2 \cdot 1009^2</m>.  However, all of these lead to pairs where <m>a \leq 0</m> or <m>b \leq 0</m>.</p></blockquote>

<title>Trig Substitution</title>
<p>When a real numbers have absolute value less than or equal to 1, consider equating them with cosines or sines.   Here is an example from the 2018 Putnam, Problem B4.</p>
<blockquote><p>Given a real number <m>a</m>, we define a sequence by <m>x_0 = 1</m>, <m>x_1 = x_2 = a</m>, and <m>x_{n+1} = 2x_n x_{n-1} - x_{n-2}</m> for <m>n \geq 2</m>. Prove that if <m>x_n = 0</m> for some <m>n</m>, then the sequence is periodic.</p></blockquote>
