	<title>Polynomial over <m>S</m></title>
	<idx>Polynomial</idx>
	<statement><p> Let <m>S</m> be a set of numbers. 
		<ul>
		<li><p>Any nonzero element of <m>S</m> is a polynomial of degree zero.</p></li>
		<li><p>Let <m>n</m> be a positive integer and <m>x \notin S</m>, <m>x \neq 0</m>.  A polynomial of degree <m>n</m> in <m>x</m> is any expression that can be written in the form <m>q(x)\cdot x + b</m>, where <m>b</m> is an element of <m>S</m> and <m>q(x)</m> is a polynomial of degree <m>n-1</m> over <m>S</m>.</p></li>

<remark><p>In the remainder of this chapter, if we simply refer to a polynomial, you can assume that it is a polynomial over any field.</p></remark>


<p>What is the  Fundamental theorem of Algebra?</p>

<p>What does it mean to divide one polynomial by a second (nonzero) polynomial? What is the result?</p>

<p>If <m>p(x)</m> and <m>q(x)</m> are polynomials of degree <m>m</m> and <m>n</m>, how are the degrees of <m>p(x) + q(x)</m>, <m>p(x)q(x)</m>,<m>p(q(x))</m>
and <m>q(p(x))</m> related to <m>m</m> and <m>n</m>?</p>

<p>Why is it customary to consider the degree of the zero polynomial to be undefined?</p>

<p>Let <m>p(x)</m> be a polynomial and <m>\alpha</m> a number.  What is the relationship between <m>p(\alpha )</m> and division of <m>p(x)</m> by <m>x - \alpha</m>?</p>

<p>If the degree of <m>p(x)</m> is <m>n</m> with roots <m>x_1</m>, <m>x_2</m>, <m>\ldots , x_n</m> (possibly repeated). How are <m>a_0</m>, <m>a_{n-2}</m> and <m>a_{n-1}</m>
related to the roots of <m>p(x)</m>?</p>

<statement><p>
 If <m>z=a + b i</m> is a complex number then <m>\bar{z}= a -b i</m> is its complex conjugate. Prove that for any two complex numbers <m>z</m> and <m>w</m>,
 <m>\overline{z+w}=\bar{z}+\bar{w}</m> and <m>\overline{z\cdot w}=\bar{z}\cdot \bar{w}</m>.   The second identity implies <m>\overline{z^n}=\bar{z}^n</m>
for all positive integers <m>n</m>, which can be proven by induction, but don{'}t do this.
