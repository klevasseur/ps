<section><title>Prerequisite Knowledge</title>
<p>The most common way to define a polynomials is as algebraic expression of the form <m>a_n x^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+ \cdots +a_1 x + a_0</m>, where <m>n</m> is a nonnegative integer, the <m>a_i</m> are in some predetermined set, and <m>x</m> is not in that set.  Alternatively, we can define polynomials recursively.</p>
<definition>
	<title>Polynomial over <m>S</m></title>
	<idx>Polynomial</idx>
	<statement><p> Let <m>S</m> be a set of numbers and <m>x</m> an element outside of <m>S</m>. 
		<ul>
		<li><p>Any nonzero element of <m>S</m> is a polynomial of degree zero.</p></li>
		<li><p>Let <m>n</m> be a positive integer and <m>x \notin S</m>, <m>x \neq 0</m>.  A polynomial of degree <m>n</m> in <m>x</m> is any expression that can be written in the form <m>q(x)\cdot x + b</m>, where <m>b</m> is an element of <m>S</m> and <m>q(x)</m> is a polynomial of degree <m>n-1</m> over <m>S</m>.</p></li>
		</ul>
		</p>
	</statement>
</definition>
<remark><p>In the remainder of this chapter, if we simply refer to a polynomial, you can assume that it is a polynomial over any field.</p></remark>

<p>What follows is a series of theorems and basic properties relating to polynomials.  Proofs are available from many sources.  We assume you are familiar with polynomial addition and multiplication, so we take division as a starting point.  The following is an analogue to the division property for integers.</p>
<theorem xml:id="theorem-poly-divison-property"><title>Division Property for Polynomials</title>
<idx>Division Property for Polynomials</idx>
<statement><p>Let <m>F</m> be a field and let <m>p(x)</m> and <m>g(x)</m> be two polynomials
of over <m>F</m> with <m>g(x) \neq  0</m>. Then there exist unique polynomials <m>q(x)</m> and <m>r(x)</m> in <m>F[x]</m> such that <m>p(x) = g(x) q(x) + r(x)</m>, where <m>r(x) = 0</m> or
<m>\deg  r(x) &lt; \deg  g(x)</m>.</p></statement></theorem>

<theorem xml:id="theorem-polynomial-remainder"><title>The Remainder Theorem</title>
<idx>Remainder Theorem for Polynomial</idx>
<statement><p>Let <m>F</m> be a field, p(x) a polynomial over <m>F</m>, and <m>a \in  F</m>. Then <m>p(x) = (x-a)q(x) + p(a)</m>, where q(x) is some polynomial over <m>F</m>.</p></statement>
</theorem> 

<p>The proof of this next theorem is advanced, but it would be reasonable to expect that you could invoke in the course of solving a problem.</p>
<theorem xml:id="theorm-ft-algebra"><title>The  Fundamental Theorem of Algebra</title>
<idx>Fundamental Theorem of Algebra</idx>
<statement><p>Every non-constant polynomial in a single variable with complex coefficients has at least one complex root.</p></statement>
</theorem>
<remark><p>You could prove by induction that <xref ref="theorm-ft-algebra" text="title"/> implies that a polynomial of degree <m>n</m> over the complex numbers can be factored into the product of <m>n</m> monomial factors. </p></remark>

<theorem><title>Vieta Relations</title><idx>Vieta Relations</idx>
<statement><p> Suppose that  <m>p(x) = \sum_{k=0}^n a_k x^k</m> has <m>n</m> roots: <m>x_1</m>, <m>x_2</m>, <m>\ldots , x_n</m> (possibly repeated).  The Vieta relations give us a way to equate these roots with the coefficients of <m>p(x)</m>. The three most commonly used of these are
<ol>
<li><p><m> \prod_{k=1}^n x_k = (-1)^n \frac{a_0}{a_n}</m></p></li>
<li><p><m> \sum_{1\le i \lt j\le n} x_i x_j = \frac{a_{n-2}}{a_n}</m></p></li>
<li><p><m> \sum_{i=1}^n x_i = - \frac{a_{n-1}}{a_n}</m></p></li>
</ol>
</p>
</statement>
</theorem>
<p>Although indeterminates are usually simple symbols like <m>x</m> or <m>y</m>, they can be any expression.  For example, <m>\cos{2 \theta}= 2 \cos{\theta} - 1</m> is a polynomial in <m>\cos{\theta}</m>.  In fact, for every positive integer <m>n</m>,  <m>\cos{n \theta}</m> is a polynomial in <m>\cos{\theta}</m>. See <xref ref="exercise-chebyshev" />.
