Definition: { }Let \textit{ S} be a set of numbers, usually the rational, real or complex numbers. { }\(a_nx^n+ a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\cdots +a_1x+a_0\)
is a polynomial over \(S\) if { }\(a_i\in S\) for all \textit{ i}. { }If \(a_n\neq 0\) then the degree of the polynomial is \(n\).

\subsection*{Basic Prerequisites (in question form):}

What is the \textit{ Fundamental theorem of Algebra }?

What does it mean to divide one polynomial by a second (nonzero) polynomial? { }What is the result?

If \(p(x)\) and \(q(x)\) are polynomials of degree \textit{ m} and \textit{ n}, how are the degrees of \(p(x) + q(x)\), \(p(x)q(x)\),\(p(q(x))\)
and \(q(p(x))\) related to \(m\) and \(n\)?

Why is it customary to consider the degree of { }the zero polynomial to be undefined?

Let \(p(x)\) be a polynomial and $\alpha $ a number. { } What is the relationship between \(p(\alpha )\) { }and division of \(p(x)\) by \(x - \alpha\)?

If the degree of \(p(x)\) is \(n\) with roots { }\(x_1\), \(x_2\), \(\ldots , x_n\) (possibly repeated). How are \(a_0\), { }\(a_{n-2}\) and { }\(a_{n-1}\)
related to the roots of \(p(x)\)? { }

<statement>
 If \(z=a + b i\) is a complex number then { }\(\bar{z}= a -b i\) is its complex conjugate. Prove that for any two complex numbers \(z\) and \(w\),
{ } \(\overline{z+w}=\bar{z}+\bar{w}\) and \(\overline{z\cdot w}=\bar{z}\cdot \bar{w}\). { } { } The second identity implies \(\overline{z^n}=\bar{z}^n\)
for all positive integers \(n\), which can be proven by induction, but don{'}t do this.

<statement>
(a) Given three real numbers \(x_0<x_1<x_2\), and three more real numbers \(y_0, y_1, y_2\), not necessarily distinct, does there always exist a
unique polynomial, \(p(x)\), of degree less than or equal to 2 such that \(p\left(x_0\right)=y_0\), \(p\left(x_1\right)=y_1\), and \(p\left(x_2\right)=y_2\)?\\
(b) { }Same as part (a) but replace \(p\left(x_2\right)=y_2\) with \(p'\left(x_2\right)=y_2\).\\
(c) Same as part (a) but replace \(p\left(x_1\right)=y_1\) with \(p'\left(x_1\right)=y_1\).
